  <p>
    In this game, you are the embodiment of the Nagoya University Global 30 Programs dream, or otherwise a meager
    character with an infinite bullet shotgun. You realized that you have been useless all of your life, which is fine
    because we all are. But you decided that this is not enough anymore. Before your last dying breath, you embark on this
    journey to make an impression on all of the best professors in the world, and that is why we are here.
  </p>

  <p>
    You start off in a desolate place called 2000 px by 2000 px arena that is a horribly resized map of Nagoya University.
    You fend off yourself from all the Compulsory Elective credits who violate the laws of nature just by existing. Once
    you have acquired yourself all of the compulsory elective credits, the gates of the Toyota Auditorium unlock, and you
    may begin impressing the great Professor Bourne.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bourne is not without needs. He, albeit the greatest mind we have ever seen, equipped with the most native English
    this university has to offer, wants a permanent position. Without a permanent position, he is hesitant in watching
    your shenanigans and has a 10x damage reduction shield. To expedite his acquisition of a permanent position,
    you may remove Professor Serge's cameras located in the corners of the arena. However, be aware that the TEBASAKI that
    another unfortunate unnamed professor has planted will try to stop you. They charge at you and gain a ridiculous speed
    boost when you destroy one camera.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="game.html">
      When you manage to impress Bourne by 100 damage, he becomes Rebourne, and everything becomes much harder. You will
      sadly have to see for yourself because I don't care enough to explain what I implemented. Try a few times if one
      time didn't work. Also, hit detection and pathfinding might still be in operation even in death, so you might be able
      to cheat. THIS IS THE START BUTTON CLICK THIS TO START!!!!!!! LOOK AT ME!!! READ ME!!!!
